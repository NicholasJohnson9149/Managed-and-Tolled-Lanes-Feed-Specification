# Managed and Tolled Lanes Feed Specification

Proposal for a schema that comprise the Managed and Tolled Lanes Tolling Feed Specification (MTLFS) and defines the fields used in all of those files.

## Why?
The goal of this effort is to establish an open format data feed specification that the managed lanes and toll industry can use which can allow for creative application development to provide customer friendly information via various means such as smart phones or provide opportunity for alternate payment systems.  This should enhance the customer decision making and experience while allowing the toll operator to share real-time information in a more direct manner than via the fixed overhead panels on the system.

## Pros
* Flexible modern JSON format which allows for easy updating, backwards compatibility 
* Easy to implement on a webserver

## Where

* Draft schema at [mtlfs.md](mtlfs.md)
* Check out the working api at [mtlfs.vta.org](https://mtlfs.vta.org)
* Server implementation code at [VTA Express Lanes API](https://github.com/vta/expresslanes-api)
