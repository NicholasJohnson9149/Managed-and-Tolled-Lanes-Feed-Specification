### Managed lane
Managed lanes are exclusive lanes within a freeway corridor, separated from the general purpose lanes, which are operated using a variety of fixed or real-time strategies, such as pricing, vehicle eligibility, or access control. Examples of managed lanes are, High Occupancy Vehicle lanes, value priced lanes (including High Occupancy Toll Lanes), and exclusive or special use lanes (such as express, bus-only, or truck-only lanes). 

### Express Lanes
An Express Lane is a conversion of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane to a toll lane in order to better manage congestion. Express Lanes (EL) provides solo drivers an option to pay a toll for a more reliable trip. The toll varies dynamically in response to the existing level of congestion, and is displayed on the overhead toll message signs at the beginning of an EL segment or corridor. Tolls are collected electronically with a FasTrak® toll tag linked to the pre-funded customer account.
Express Lanes are free for carpools, vanpools, buses, motorcycles and other toll-exempt vehicles. Some express lanes in the bay area require a FasTrak Flex® toll tag to travel toll-free. Outside posted hours of operation, express lanes are open to general traffic at no charge and have no requirements for FasTrak or vehicle occupancy.

### Dynamic pricing
Dynamic pricing, also called real-time pricing, is an approach to setting the toll rates that adjust to the existing level of congestion. Through the use of dynamic pricing, operators can manage the amount of traffic in the express lanes and maintain free-flowing speeds even when the general purpose lanes are congested. Motorists who choose to use the express lanes will benefit from reliable travel times. Bay area express lanes are currently planned to operate based on dynamic tolling. 

### Hours of Express Lanes
This varies. Hours of operations are either identical to predetermined carpool lane hours, or modified per corridor.
 
### Static tolling ### hourly-based toll
Static toll or fixed toll refers to toll rates that are fixed and cannot be exceeded by the varying level of congestion. Examples of fixed toll rate are bridges.

### Zone
A Zone consists of a set of contiguous Read Points in a single direction of travel with a single toll rate. 
A zone is the smallest unit to describe a section of a toll road. Multiple zones make up one segment. Each zone pricing will be set by the traffic in that zone, price in that zone defines the price paid to travel the segment.

### Segment
A segment is a larger part of the toll road, composed of multiple zones. A subset of a Corridor between ‘major destinations’. 

### Corridor
A continuous stretch of the express lane roadway operated by the same operator and containing predefined start and end points. 

### Read Points
Read Points are locations where the Electronic Toll System detects vehicles, reads transponders, and captures images in order to create Lane Transactions for all Express Lanes going in the same direction. 

### SOV
Single Occupancy Vehicle, typically a car with one person.

### HOV
High Occupancy Vehicle, A vehicle with two or more people, a motorcycle, or bus.
